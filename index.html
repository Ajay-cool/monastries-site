<div>
    <img src="images/lamayuru-monastery.jpg" class="lamayuru" alt="">
<p class="intro-lamayuru">Founded in th 11th century, Lamayuru is
  one of the oldest and largest Buddhist monasteries in Ladakh.
The monastery is located on Steep Mountain; the monastery is renowned
 as ‘Tharpa Ling’ which translates to the ‘place of freedom’. </p>
</div>
<p class="lamayuru-p-two">Every 5th month of the Tibetan Lunar Calendar, a holy mask dance is performed by the monks inside the monastery which is a great spectacle.
In the past, Lamayuru has housed up to 400 lamas, but presently there are only 30 to 50 lamas living here, although about 150 lamas belong to the gompa.
In the 16th century, Ladakh's King Jamyang Namgyal was cured of leprosy by a lama from Tibet. In gratitude, the King gave Lamayuru gompa to this lama and also bestowed other privileges - no taxes were collected and the area surrounding the gompa was declared a sanctuary where none
 could be arrested. For this reason, Ladakhis still refer to Lamayuru gompa as Tharpa Ling, the "Place of Freedom"
